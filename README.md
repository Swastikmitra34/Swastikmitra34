## 🧠 Key Domains I Work In

### 🧬 Artificial Intelligence  
**Text-to-Video Diffusion Equation**  
dx = f(x, t)dt + g(t)dw

yaml
Copy
Edit

> Describes the continuous stochastic process used in denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), the foundation of generative text-to-video AI.

### 📐 Pure Mathematics  
**Generalized Stokes' Theorem**  
∫∂M ω = ∫M dω

markdown
Copy
Edit

> Unifies Green's, Gauss's, and Stokes' theorems into one elegant identity in differential geometry.  
Where:  
- `M` is a smooth oriented manifold with boundary `∂M`,  
- `ω` is a differential form on `M`,  
- `dω` is the exterior derivative of `ω`.

### ⚛ Quantum Computing  
**Qubit Superposition**  
|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, with |α|² + |β|² = 1

yaml
Copy
Edit

> A qubit exists in a linear combination of `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`, core to quantum parallelism and entanglement.

### 📊 Quantitative Finance  
**Black-Scholes Model (SDE form)**  
dSₜ = μSₜdt + σSₜdWₜ

yaml
Copy
Edit

> A stochastic differential equation describing the dynamics of asset prices under geometric Brownian motion, used in options pricing.
